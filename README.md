🚀 Project Alert! 🎉

I'm excited to share my latest creation – Huddle Landing Page 🧩✨
Built using React.js and styled with pure CSS, this sleek, responsive landing page demonstrates clean UI design, component-based architecture, and smooth user experience.

🎯 What I worked on:

    🔹 Modular React components for easy scalability

    🎨 Custom CSS styling for a modern, responsive layout

    📱 Mobile-first design for seamless performance across devices

    🧠 Focused on minimalism and clear call-to-action design principles

This project challenged my frontend skills and helped me explore better design thinking while writing clean, reusable code.
